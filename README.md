Task 3 – CNN Image Classification with Fashion MNIST
 
## About the Project
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is also designed to predict classes for custom grayscale images (28×28 pixels), making it suitable for both academic and real-world applications.

This task is part of the CodTech IT Solutions Machine Learning Internship.# Task-3IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL
IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL

Objectives
Train a CNN model to classify Fashion MNIST images into 10 clothing categories

Apply transformations such as normalization, cropping, and augmentation

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss curves

Load and classify custom input images using the trained model
